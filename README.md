## Integrity Check (SHA256 Hash)

To ensure you are using the original, unmodified version of `AAD_v4.0.md` as published in this repository, you can verify its SHA256 hash.

**SHA256 Hash for `AAD_v4.0.md`:**
`30cd18f0d29e7f971f3238800c3f2174d60f5639fed23764f1ddeb9ee4309e24`

**How to Verify:**

1.  Download the `AAD_v4.0.md` file from this repository.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where you saved the file.
3.  Run one of the following commands based on your operating system:
    *   **Linux/macOS:** `shasum -a 256 AAD_v4.0.md`
    *   **Windows (PowerShell):** `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 AAD_v4.0.md | Format-List`
    *   Alternatively, you can use the provided `calculate_hash.py` script: `python3 calculate_hash.py` (ensure `AAD_v4.0.md` is in the same directory as the script).
4.  Compare the output hash with the one published above. They should match exactly.

## Versioning

It is recommended to refer to specific versions of the `AAD_v4.0.md` document for stable and reproducible AI agent behavior. You can do this by referencing specific commit hashes or Git tags from this repository when including the doctrine in your prompts.
